    "Income inequality, where income is distributed unevenly among a population, is a growing problem in developing nations across the world. With the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and worker automation, this problem could continue to grow if steps are not taken to address the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount. This solution can potentially reduce costs and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as income levels in between census years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate income predictions can provide valuable insights that help policymakers better manage and avoid income inequality globally. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a robust tool for analyzing income distribution, which is crucial for developing effective socioeconomic policies and interventions.\n",

    "#### **Business Objective**\n",
    "To address income inequality by providing accurate and timely predictions of individual income levels, aiding policymakers in their efforts to manage and reduce income disparity effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Needs:** A model to accurately predict if an individual earns above 50,000 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Goals**\n",
    "- To create a machine learning model to predict if an individual earns above 50,000 USD.\n",
    "- To create an API for user interaction\n",

    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between wages per hour and income level above 50,000 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analytical Questions**\n",
    "1. What are the key factors influencing whether an individual earns above 50,000 USD?\n",
    "2. How does the number of hours worked per week impact income level predictions?\n",
    "3. What role do education level and occupation play in determining income above the specified threshold?\n",
    "4. Are there any significant regional differences in income levels above 50,000 USD?\n",
    "5. How does industry type impact income level?\n",
